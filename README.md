## Description

The application can be used to create readme files, dynamically, from user inputs. My personal favorite section to work with was using the fs functions to create and remove folders/ files.

## Installation

Install node.js. navigate to my github profile, linked below, and clone the jh-inquire-readme-creation to your machine. install inquirer 8.2.7

## Usage

Navigate to the file with your console and type "node index" to run the file and follow the prompts. node.js and inquirer library need to be installed prior to this.

## Contributions

Just me

## Tests

A folder will be created to deposit the created readme files. After you have run the program in your terminal, navigate the the Xtreme_Readme file to view your created readme.md file

## Licensing

No License Provided
